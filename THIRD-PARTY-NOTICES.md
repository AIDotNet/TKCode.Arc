# Third-party notices

TKCode.Arc ports the design and behavior of the free components of Arc and uses the
assets and libraries listed below.

## Arc (uiarc.dev) — free components and blocks

TKCode.Arc reimplements the free (MIT) components of Arc for Avalonia, and `TKCode.Arc.Blocks` ports
Arc's free (MIT) blocks (Page header, Command palette, Notification center, Empty states, Site header, Site footer, CTA section, Newsletter signup, OTP input and the Email code, Centered and Sign up login blocks). The code,
styles, text and assets of Arc Pro components and blocks are not used, copied or reconstructed. A few Pro
counterparts (the data grid, the Sidebar and Search results blocks, the AI blocks, the Showpieces blocks, the Projects blocks and the
five AI explainers and the five AI components (agent status, tool call, agent plan, agent timeline, context
window) in `TKCode.Arc.Special`, and the Split and Immersive login blocks, Onboarding illustration and Multi-step form in
`TKCode.Arc.Blocks`) are
original TKCode designs that take the behavior and look Arc publishes as a design reference; their code, copy,
sample data and images are written from scratch (the Showpieces' land outlines come from Natural Earth, below).

## Natural Earth — land outlines

`TKCode.Arc.Blocks` embeds a 0.5° land mask made from **Natural Earth** 1:110m Physical Vectors, Land
(`ne_110m_land`), for the `RevenueGlobe` block's dotted continents (`tools/geo/generate_land_mask.py` rasterizes the
polygons; the mask is `Blocks/Showpieces/RevenueGlobe/Resources/land-mask.bin`, 32 KB). Natural Earth data is in
the public domain. Made with Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data at https://www.naturalearthdata.com.

## Fonts

- Inter (SIL Open Font License 1.1), used through the `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter` package.
- Geist and Geist Mono (SIL Open Font License 1.1, Copyright (c) 2023 Vercel, in collaboration with basement.studio), bundled in the optional `TKCode.Arc.Fonts` package; the full license text ships as `licenses/Geist-OFL.txt` (source: `src/TKCode.Arc.Fonts/Assets/OFL.txt`).
- Silkscreen (SIL Open Font License 1.1, Copyright 2001 The Silkscreen Project Authors) and VT323 (SIL Open Font License 1.1, Copyright 2011 The VT323 Project Authors), bundled in `TKCode.Arc.Fonts` for the pixel theme as `fonts:ArcPixel`; the license texts ship as `licenses/Silkscreen-OFL.txt` and `licenses/VT323-OFL.txt` (sources: `src/TKCode.Arc.Fonts/Assets/`).
- Noto Sans SC (SIL Open Font License 1.1, © 2014-2021 Adobe), subset to the characters of the gallery (`tools/fonts/subset-noto-sans-sc.py`) as `NotoSansSC-Subset.otf` in the gallery's WebAssembly host, which has no system fonts for Chinese text; the license text ships beside it as `wwwroot/fonts/OFL.txt`.

## StreamMark — Markdown rendering and code highlighting

`TKCode.Arc` references the StreamMark packages (`TKCode.StreamMark.Core`, `TKCode.StreamMark.Avalonia`,
`TKCode.StreamMark.Highlighting.TextMate`) as published NuGet binaries. They render the `Markdown` control and
tokenize the code of `CodeBlock`. StreamMark.Core contains a C# port of remend from vercel/streamdown
(Apache License 2.0, Copyright 2023 Vercel, Inc.); see StreamMark's own third-party notices.

TextMateSharp.Grammars embeds TextMate grammars, language configurations and color themes, most of them taken
from Visual Studio Code (MIT License, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation) and the grammar repositories it
bundles (MIT, TextMate bundle license, Apache-2.0, BSD and GitHub licenses). The `cgmanifest.json` files embedded
in the package record the source and license of each grammar. TKCode.Arc tokenizes with VS Code's Light+ theme
and paints the result in its own palette.

### Onigwrap and Oniguruma

TextMateSharp runs its regular expressions on the native Oniguruma library through Onigwrap (native libraries per
runtime identifier). Onigwrap: MIT License, Copyright (c) 2024 Aikawa Yataro, derived from fluentCODE/onigwrap
(MIT License, Copyright (c) 2015 Fluent Solutions). Oniguruma:
